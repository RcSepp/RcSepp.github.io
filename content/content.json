			"title": "Solving Communication-Intensive Problems Efficiently Using On-Chip Mesh Interconnection Networks",
			"brief": "My Bachelor's thesis about a mesh-connected array processor architecture was presented with a research poster at ISC HPC 2016.",
			"abstract": "Many mathematical procedures and physical processes are based on highly parallel interaction of information carriers. Traditional concurrent software focuses on adapting established sequential programming models towards increasingly parallel execution. However, communication overhead is still considered a limiting factor, because none of the current processors are really as fast at communicating as they are at computing. Since the late 1970s systolic arrays and other array processors have been developed that exploit the flow of data to implement parallelism, but none of them got engineered to a point where they could be considered general purpose coprocessors. We propose a processor architecture based on a two or three dimensional mesh of processor cores, called the Mesh Processing Unit (MPU). The MPU also represents the first attempt of mapping domain data flow directly to algorithmic topology. The network connecting processors is not a black box, but itâ€˜s the framework for the algorithms that are designed on-top of it. Our work consists of finding a versatile topology for an MPU, simulating program execution by designing a domain specific programing language for it, designing a representative set of algorithms using this language, and evaluating performance of the designed algorithms compared to existing solutions on traditional hardware. The results of our runtime- and utilization benchmarks reveal that MPUs are a capable platform for modern data flow hardware and enable us to invest further research into MPU architecture and algorithm design, as well as the design of a hardware prototype.",

			"title": "Interactive Colormapping: Enabling Multiple Data Range and Detailed Views of Ocean Salinity",
			"brief": "CHI 2016 paper about ColorMoves",
			"abstract": "Ocean salinity is a critical component to understanding climate change. Salinity concentrations and temperature drive large ocean currents which in turn drive global weather patterns. Melting ice caps lower salinity at the poles while river deltas bring fresh water into the ocean worldwide. These processes slow ocean currents, changing weather patterns and producing extreme climate events which disproportionally affect those living in poverty. Analysis of salinity presents a unique visualization challenge. Important data are found in narrow data ranges, varying with global location. Changing values of salinity are important in understanding ocean currents, but are difficult to map to colors using traditional tools. Commonly used colormaps may not provide sufficient detail for this data. Current editing tools do not easily enable a scientist to explore the subtleties of salinity. We present a workflow, enabled by an interactive colormap tool that allows a scientist to interactively apply sophisticated colormaps to scalar data. The intuitive and immediate interaction of the scientist with the data is a critical contribution of this work.",

			"abstract": "Capturing atomic motion in spectroscopy for observation and quantitatively correlating structure-property relationships with functionality generates insight into physics and chemistry of 2D materials. Feature detection is a widely used technique for extracting atomic motion vectors.
